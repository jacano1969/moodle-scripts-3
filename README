Automation Scripts for Moodle

config.php - contains the central config variables for use in the other scripts

reset.php - resets the databases for the moodle instances listed in config.php. Will eventually restore default course data and users.
NOTE: this should be run as root.

update.php - updates the source code of the moodle instances from GIT and run the update and cron scripts for the instances.

recreate.php - coming soon - will rebuild the instances from the GIT source and reinstall them.
